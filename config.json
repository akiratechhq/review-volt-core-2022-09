We can see that by following the call stack in the canonical implementation:\r\n\r\nMint calls `mintInternal`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/a3214f67b73310d547e00fc578e8355911c9d376/contracts/CErc20.sol#L43-L52\r\n\r\nWhich calls `mintFresh`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/a3214f67b73310d547e00fc578e8355911c9d376/contracts/CToken.sol#L381-L390\r\n\r\nThe method `mintFresh` does a few things, but we're interested in the part where tokens are moved, which happens in `doTransferIn`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/a3214f67b73310d547e00fc578e8355911c9d376/contracts/CToken.sol#L392-L398\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/a3214f67b73310d547e00fc578e8355911c9d376/contracts/CToken.sol#L416-L424\r\n\r\nWhich tries to transfer the tokens from the caller (`ERC20CompoundPCVDeposit`) in the `CToken` implementation:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/a3214f67b73310d547e00fc578e8355911c9d376/contracts/CErc20.sol#L152-L182\r\n\r\nFollowing this complete call stack we see that the tokens are indeed moved in the `CToken` implementation.\r\n\r\nThus, when a user wants to deposit tokens in the contract `ERC20CompoundPCVDeposit`, they need to do these two actions:\r\n\r\n- send tokens to `ERC20CompoundPCVDeposit`\r\n- call `ERC20CompoundPCVDeposit.deposit()`\r\n\r\nThe method `deposit()` expects the tokens to be in the contract before the method is executed. This isn't obvious, but we made sure that's the case by discussing it with the development team and checking the canonical Compound implementation.\r\n\r\nHaving the tokens in the contract before `deposit()` is called, leaves room for attackers to front-run the execution of `deposit()`.\r\n\r\nEven if Compound implements this approach, it doesn't mean the same pattern needs to be implemented in `ERC20CompoundPCVDeposit`.\r\n\r\nHowever, having the tokens in `ERC20CompoundPCVDeposit` exposes the user to front-running attacks.\r\n\r\nWe can protect the user in a few ways.\r\n\r\n1. Create a proxy contract that bundles together `transfer` and `deposit`. This will be similar to how the tests currently work, since both actions happen synchronously and there is no possibility to front-run the execution of `deposit`. We can see this approach in the tests included in the repository that the `transfer` and `deposit` happen one after the other:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/akiratechhq/review-volt-core-2022-09/blob/5826c86d97f928c23d23c5d2b6cabefba4649e67/code/contracts/test/integration/IntegrationTestCompoundPCVDeposits.t.sol#L44-L52\r\n\r\nBut this does not correctly simulate an external user interacting with the system because a user will likely create two separate transactions.\r\n\r\nWe can fix this if we only allow the users to interact with `ERC20CompoundPCVDeposit` through a contract.\r\n\r\nGoing in this direction, the development team needs to do a few things:\r\n\r\n- create a proxy actions contract that implements the desired interaction with the protocol;\r\n- add limits in `deposit()` to ensure `msg.sender` is a contract, reducing the risk of users sending the transactions one after the other.\r\n\r\nImplementing a proxy actions contract is a lot of work since the dev team will need to implement the action bundle described above and also every other action possible in the system. It also adds additional gas costs since a proxy action contract might be needed for each user before interacting with the system.\r\n\r\nTaking this approach doesn't seem to be the ideal one, since a lot of additional work needs to be put in. However, we have an alternative \ud83d\udc47 \r\n\r\n2. Modify `ERC20CompoundPCVDeposit` to use `transferFrom`\r\n\r\nA different implementation of `deposit` can protect the user from being front-run while reducing the amount of development work.\r\n\r\nIdeally we would add an argument to `deposit()` to specify the amount of tokens to deposit. This allows us to transfer the amount of tokens to `ERC20CompoundPCVDeposit` and call `CErc20(address(cToken)).mint(_amount)` which would safely move the tokens around.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n/// @notice deposit ERC-20 tokens to Compound\r\nfunction deposit(uint256 _amount) external override whenNotPaused {\r\n    token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);\r\n\r\n    // Compound returns non-zero when there is an error\r\n    require(\r\n        CErc20(address(cToken)).mint(_amount) == 0,\r\n        \"ERC20CompoundPCVDeposit: deposit error\"\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    emit Deposit(msg.sender, _amount);\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the method signature can't be changed because `IPCVDeposit` needs a `deposit()` method with no arguments, we can take a different approach.\r\n\r\n- Find out the amount of tokens the user has in their possession;\r\n- Find out the approval amount the user allows `ERC20CompoundPCVDeposit` to transfer in their behalf;\r\n- Deposit the minimum of the two values.\r\n\r\nAn example implementation would look like this:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n/// @notice deposit ERC-20 tokens to Compound\r\nfunction deposit() external override whenNotPaused {\r\n    // We need the minimum of the two values, because the user \r\n    // might approve more than their balance \r\n    uint256 amount = min(\r\n        // The amount of tokens we are allowed to move\r\n        token.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)),\r\n        // The user's total balance\r\n        token.balanceOf(msg.sender)\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);\r\n\r\n    // Compound returns non-zero when there is an error\r\n    require(\r\n        CErc20(address(cToken)).mint(amount) == 0,\r\n        \"ERC20CompoundPCVDeposit: deposit error\"\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    emit Deposit(msg.sender, amount);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease do not use the example code verbatim since they haven't been tested at all and make sure to thoroughly test before doing the update.\r\n\r\n**Recommendation**\r\n\r\nConsider the two options and see if any presented approaches make sense to implement to protect the users from being front-run.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n- [MakerDAO's DSSProxy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x82ecd135dce65fbc6dbdd0e4237e0af93ffd5038#code)\r\n- [OpenZeppelin Proxy](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Proxy)\r\n- [FIATDAO Action implementation](https://github.com/fiatdao/actions)",
